# Inspecting and Cleansing Datasets Using Python 

In order to do well in this course all you need to have is a willingness to learn Python! A little bit of data engineering knowledge helps too. 

# Introduction 

I have over 7 years experience as a Data Scientist in the 'real world' including working for Big Four consulting firms. I started out as a Junior Data Engineer then transitioned to a Data Scientist. Many of my everyday problems I solve revolve around cleansing data. 

Forbes.com did a study in 2016 where they asked a handful of data scientist what their job pertains. This was done to simple show what areas data scientist focus on the most.
