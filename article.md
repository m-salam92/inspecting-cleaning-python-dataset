# Inspecting and Cleansing Datasets Using Python 

In order to do well in this course all you need to have is a willingness to learn Python! A little bit of data engineering knowledge helps too. 

# Introduction 

I have over 7 years experience as a Data Scientist in the 'real world' including working for Big Four consulting firms. I started out as a Junior Data Engineer then transitioned to a Data Scientist. Many of my everyday problems I solve revolve around cleansing data. 

Forbes.com did a study in 2016 where they asked a handful of data scientist what their job pertains. This was done to simple show what areas data scientist focus on the most. The results may surprise you...

As you can see in the graphic, 60% of the time Data Scientist are spending cleaning and organizing data! 
Now that I have gotten you really excited to start lets get our hands dirty and get to it!


# Data Exploration 

I have built a sample Employee Database Dataset consisting of few sample rows. Here are the following Data Attributes. 

- Emp_ID: Unique Employee ID
- First_Name: Employee's First Name
- Last_Name: Employee's Last Name
- Emp_Lvl: Employee's Rank Level
- Emp_Dept: Main Department Employee is assigned to
- Emp_Salary: Employee's Annual Base Salary 
- Emp_State: State Employee resides in
